All right, all right, I understand what's going on.
Being faced with perfection is so rare
You feel all funny, all weird.
It's adorable. It's adorable.
Humans don't change, they love stars
Open your eyes
Let's get started.
You can pinch yourself, yes, it's me, Maui!
A true demigod, this hair, this body
Yes, I'm the handsomest, I'm the strongest
How to tell you it's for you men
That I created the universe
It's natural, it's for you, you men
I am a very ordinary demigod
Hey! Who of his thumbs lifted the skies
When you were dancing the Hula?
This god
When it was cold
Who went to get you a light?
It's one of us.
Oh, and the lasso sun
For men
The days are longer and more beautiful
And I attracted the breeze
For men
Making you happy is my motto
How can I tell you this, it was natural
To put islands on the ocean
But it's nothing, it's nothing sensational.
Ha! I did it for men, simply for men.
For men!
For men!
Yes, I can tell you that.
I'm really a funny kind of freak.
I am at the origin of all phenomena
The waves, the flowers, the wind?
That for Maui, it's just child's play
I killed the eel, I buried it
And now here's a coconut tree
And the lesson, the moral of the story
Respect Maui, it's not the sea to drink
On my skin I have a very beautiful fresco
For my titanic super exploits
And wherever I go
I give the cadence
While the little mini me he dances, dances, dances, dances!
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Hey
I wanted it, I did it for men
To offer a wonderful world
How can I say this, it was for men
But he must go away the demigod
After what I did for men
They can offer me a boat.
This time I'm going away, I'm going away from men
Maui dreamed of going out on the water
Away from men!
Away from men!
Thank you, ciao!

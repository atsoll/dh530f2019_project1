The blue of the sky is not the blue of the sea
This blue that I prefer
Without really knowing why
I would so much like to remain faithful to my land
Forget the ephemeral wind
I've tried so many times
I may say I'm staying
I will not leave
Each of my gestures
Every step I take
Keeps bringing me back
Despite the promises made
Towards this light blue
The horizon where the sea touches the sky
And calls me
Hiding a treasure
That everyone ignores
It is the wind slowly rising and revealing itself to me
The blue of the water
If I leave, I will go further and higher
You have to love my island and its history
For those who still want to believe in it
Forget the passing of time
You have to love my island and its history
And still have hope
Someday I'll find my place
I can guide them
Make them bigger
Support them
I will take the time
But this hidden voice
Think of it differently
I don't understand.
The sun comes to dance on the sea
Eternal
And all of them don't know
These golden reflections
She's waiting for me under a carpet of light
The sea calls me
I want to see
Behind the clouds
New shores
The horizon where the sea touches the sky
And calls me
Hiding a treasure
That everyone ignores
It is the wind slowly rising and revealing itself to me
That I have the right to
To go there

Winter slowly settles in at night
Snow is queen in turn
A kingdom of solitude
My place is here, forever
The wind that howls in me no longer thinks about tomorrow
He's way too strong.
I fought in vain
Hide your powers, don't talk about them
Be careful, the secret will survive
No moods, no torments
Of feelings
Released, delivered
I will never lie again
Released, issued
It's decided, I'm leaving
I left my childhood in the summer
Lost in the winter
Cold is for me the price of freedom
When you take height
Everything seems insignificant
Sadness, anguish and fear
have long since left me
I want to see what I can do.
Of this magic full of mystery
Good, bad, I say too bad
Never mind!
Released, delivered
The stars are reaching out to me
Released, delivered
No, I'm not crying.
Here I am
Yes, I'm here.
Lost in the winter
My power comes from the sky and invades space
My soul expresses itself by drawing and sculpting in the ice
And my thoughts are frozen crystal flowers
I'm not coming back.
The past is over!
Released, delivered
From now on nothing stops me
Released, delivered
No more perfect princess
I'm here, just like I dreamed.
Lost in the winter
Cold is for me the price of freedom

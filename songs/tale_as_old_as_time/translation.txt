Eternal history
That you never believe
From two strangers
That an unexpected gesture
Rapproche en secret
And then suddenly it comes down to
On their hearts in celebration
A pink butterfly
Nothing, not much, not much.
A free flower
Nothing is alike
Nothing is the same anymore
But how do you know
Fear is gone
That we were wrong
Eternal song
With faded choruses
That's right, that's strange.
To see how we change
Without even thinking about it
Just like the stars
Sneak out
The eternal history
Touch of his wing
Beauty and the Beast
The eternal history
Touch of his wing
Beauty and the Beast
